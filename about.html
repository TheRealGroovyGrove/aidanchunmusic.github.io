  <section class="content" >
      <p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px">Aidan Chun is a composer, bassoonist, and conductor from Oahu, Hawaii. A graduate of Punahou School in Manoa, he is currently studying composition with Dr. Christopher Castro, bassoon performance with Elliott Moreau, and conducting with Dr. Danko Drusko, Dr. Geoffrey Pope, and Carl St. Clair.

Throughout the academic year, Aidan regularly performs across Southern California, and during the winter and summer months, he returns to Hawaii to perform in his home community. His diverse musical repertoire spans chamber music, standard classical works, and film scores, including live-to-picture performances.

Aidanâ€™s compositions draw inspiration from his Japanese and Hawaiian heritage, as well as from his personal experiences. His works have been performed by esteemed ensembles, including the Juilliard String Quartet and Brightwork Ensemble.

Outside of his music, Aidan enjoys hiking, fishing, and staying connected to his community through ongoing bassoon performances.</p>
